# maintainer-tools

## Workflows

Workflows for use by maintainers. These should be run from your fork of this repository, with
an [encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) called
`ACCESS_TOKEN` that is a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `repo` and `workflow`
scopes.

### PR Script

The PR Script Workflow allows you to make a commit against a PR as a maintainer without having
to check out the PR locally and push the change. The manual workflow takes as its inputs a link to the PR
and a comma-separated list of quoted commands to run. As a convenience, you can also type "True" for the
option to run pre-commit against the PR to fix up any pre-commit errors.

## Actions

## Base Setup

Use this action to consolidate setup steps and caching in your workflows. You can control the versions of Python and Node used by setting `matrix.python-version` and `matrix.node-version`, respectively.
An example workflow file would be:

```yaml
name: Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Base Setup
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
      - name: Install
        shell: bash
        run: pip install -e ".[test]"
      - name: Test
        shell: bash
        run: pytest
```

If you want to use your minimum dependencies, you can use the following
option, which will create a constraints file and set the `PIP_CONSTRAINT`
environment variable, so that installations will use that file.
By default the Python version will be "3.11", which can be overridden with
`python_version`.  Note that the environment variable also works if
you use virtual environments like `hatch`.

```yaml
  minimum_version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Base Setup
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
        with:
          dependency_type: minimum
      - name: Install
        run: pip install -e ".[test]"
      - name: Test
        run: pytest
```

If you want to run against prereleases and the latest stable Python,
use the following, which will install Python 3.11 and set the
`PIP_PRE` environment variable::

```yaml
  prereleases:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Base Setup
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
        with:
          dependency_type: pre
      - name: Install
        run: pip install -e ".[test]"
      - name: Test
        run: pytest
```

## Check Links

Use this action to check the links in your repo using `pytest-check-links`.
It will ignore links to GitHub and cache links to save time.

When adding this to a repo, you may need to skip some files or links.
If the build fails, you can copy the "Checking files with command" used in the
build, and add the appropriate `--ignore-glob` and `--check-links-ignore` until
the tests pass locally, and add them as `ignore_glob` and `ignore_links` inputs
to the action, respectively.

```yaml
name: Check Links

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/check-links@v1
```

## Enforce Labels

Use this action to enforce one of the triage labels on PRs in your repo (one of `documentation`, `bug`, `enhancement`, `feature`, `maintenance`). An example workflow file would be:

```yaml
name: Enforce PR label

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled, opened, edited, synchronize]

jobs:
  enforce-label:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: enforce-triage-label
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/enforce-label@v1
```

## Pre-Commit Check

Use this action to run a pre commit check with a manual stage. It
will print a suitable error message on failure.

```yaml
name: Pre-Commit Check
on:

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  pre_commit:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
    - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/pre-commit@v1
```

## Test Downstream Libraries

Use this action to test a package against downstream libraries. This can be used to catch breaking changes prior to merging them. An example workflow file would be:

```yaml
name: Downstream Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Base Setup
      uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
    - name: Test Against Foo
      uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/downstream-test@v1
      with:
        package_name: foo
    - name: Test Against Bar
      uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/downstream-test@v1
      with:
        package_name: bar
        env_values: "FIZZ=buzz NAME=snuffy"
```

To test against a prerelease use `package_download_extra_args: "--pre"`.

## Test Against Dependency Minimum Version

**DEPRECATED**.  Use `dependency_type: minimum` in the `base-setup` action
instead.

Use this action to test that your minimum dependency version constraints are vaild. Note: you may want to also use the minimum supported version of Python
since the minimum versions might not have wheels on newer Pythons. Note that you should use `pytest -W default` if you are using `filterwarnings` and relying on newer versions of the library to have removed warnings.

```yaml
name: Minimum Dependencies

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test_minimums:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Base Setup
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
        with:
          python_version: "3.8" # Test against minimum Python version as well
      - name: Install minimum versions
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/install-minimums@v1
      - name: Run the unit tests
        run: pytest -vv -W default
```

## Test SDist

Use this pair of actions to build an sdist for your package, and then test it
in an isolated environment.

```yaml
name: Test Sdist
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  make_sdist:
    name: Make SDist
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/make-sdist@v1

  test_sdist:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [make_sdist]
    name: Install from SDist and Test
    timeout-minutes: 20
    steps:
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/test-sdist@v1
```

## PR Binder Link

Use this action to add binder links for testing PRs, which show up as a comment.
You can use the optional `url_path` parameter to use a different url than the default `lab`.
An example workflow would be:

```yaml
name: Binder Badge
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  binder:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/binder-link@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
```

## PR Script

You can use the PR Script action in your repo along with [pull-request-comment-trigger](https://github.com/Khan/pull-request-comment-trigger) to enable maintainers to comment on PRs to run
a script against a pull request. The script can only be run by a org member, collaborator, or repo owner if the association parameter is used (as in the examples below).

Note that the resulting commit will _not_ trigger the
workflows to run again. You will have to close/reopen the PR, or push another
commit for the workflows to run again. If this behavior is not desirable,
you can use a personal access token instead of the default GitHub token provided
to the workflow. Make sure the token used is of as limited scope as possible (preferrably a bot account token with access to the `public_repo` scope only).

This first example allows maintainers to run `pre-commit` by commenting
"auto run pre-commit" on a Pull Request.

```yaml
name: Trigger Pre-Commit on a PR
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  pr-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: khan/pull-request-comment-trigger@1.0.0
        id: check
        with:
          trigger: "auto run pre-commit"
      - if: steps.check.outputs.triggered == 'true'
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
      - if: steps.check.outputs.triggered == 'true'
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/pr-script@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          pre_commit: true
          commit_message: "auto run pre-commit"
          target: ${{ github.event.issue.html_url }}
          association: ${{ github.event.comment.author_association }}
```

In this example, the repo has a custom script that should be run, which is
triggered by a PR comment "auto run cleanup". Again, this can only be run
by a org member, collaborator, or repo owner.

```yaml
name: Trigger a Cleanup Script on a PR
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  pr-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: khan/pull-request-comment-trigger@1.0.0
        id: check
        with:
          trigger: "auto run cleanup"
      - if: steps.check.outputs.triggered == 'true'
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
      - if: steps.check.outputs.triggered == 'true'
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/pr-script@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: '["jlpm run integrity", "jlpm run lint"]'
          commit_message: "auto run cleanup"
          target: ${{ github.event.issue.html_url }}
          association: ${{ github.event.comment.author_association }}
```

## Upload Coverage and Report Coverage

These actions are meant to be used together, to combine and enforce coverage.
A coverage snapshot will be included in the workflow summary.  If coverage
is below threshold, the `report-coverage` action will fail and upload the
html report.

```yaml
name: Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/base-setup@v1
      - run: |
          pip install -e ".[test]"
          python -m coverage run -m pytest
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/upload-coverage@v1
  coverage_report:
    name: Combine & check coverage
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/report-coverage@v1
        with:
          fail_under: 90
```

## Update snapshots

You can use _update snapshots_ action to commit on a branch
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) updated snapshots.

The requirements and constrains are:

- You must be on the branch to which the snapshots will be committed
- You must installed your project before calling the action
- The action is using `yarn` package manager by default but can be configured with `npm_client`
- The Playwright tests must be in TypeScript or JavaScript

An example of workflow that get triggered when a PR comment contains
_update playwright snapshots_ would be:

```yaml
name: Update Playwright Snapshots

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  update-snapshots:
    if: ${{ github.event.issue.pull_request && contains(github.event.comment.body, 'update playwright snapshots') }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Checkout the branch from the PR that triggered the job
        run: |
          # PR branch remote must be checked out using https URL
          git config --global hub.protocol https
          hub pr checkout ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Install your project
        run: |
          # Execute the required installation command

      - name: Update snapshots
        uses: jupyterlab/maintainer-tools/.github/actions/update-snapshots@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Test folder within your repository
          test_folder: playwright-tests

          # Optional npm scripts (the default values are displayed)
          # Script to start the server or 'null' if Playwright is taking care of it
          #   If not `null`, you must provide a `server_url` to listen to.
          start_server_script: start
          # Server url to wait for before updating the snapshots
          #  See specification for https://github.com/iFaxity/wait-on-action `resource`
          server_url: http-get://localhost:8888
          update_script: test:update
```
